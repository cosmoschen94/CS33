1.
Because the following instruction changes the correct answer into incorrect answer:
0x00000000005436af <arith_driver+431>lisp.h:700	      lea 0x0(,%rbp,4),%rax rax=0xce39231c6f4c71bc

Here the correct answer should be:
rbp = -5508385274225025937

2.
I looked at the lisp.h and limits.h files and found the following:

#define MOST_POSITIVE_FIXNUM (EMACS_INT_MAX >> INTTYPEBITS)
INTTYPEBITS = GCTYPEBITS - 1
#define GCTYPEBITS 3
EMACS_INT - signed integer wide enough to hold an Emacs value
EMACS_INT_MAX - maximum value of EMACS_INT
#  define EMACS_INT_MAX INT_MAX
INT_MAX=0X7fffffffffffffff=2^63-1

Therefore,
MOST_POSTIVE_FIXNUM= 0X7fffffffffffffff >> (3-1) = 2305843009213693951=2^61-1

3.
In data.c, I found a switch statement that checks multiplication overflow, shown below:

case Amult:
  if (INT_MULTIPLY_OVERFLOW (accum, next))
    {
      EMACS_UINT a = accum, b = next, ab = a * b;
      overflow = 1;
      accum = ab & INTMASK;
    }
  else
    accum *= next;
  break;

Below are corresponding instructions:

0x00000000005437c8 <arith_driver+712>data.c:2645     imul %rdi,%rbp

Before:
rdi=0x1fffffffffffffff
rbp=0x1fffffffffffffff

After:
rdi=0xc000000000000001

0x000000000054363d <arith_driver+317>data.c:2642	movabs $0x3fffffffffffffff,%rbp

Before:
rbp=0x1fffffffffffffff

After:
rbp=0x3fffffffffffffff

0x0000000000543647 <arith_driver+327>data.c:2642	and %rdi,%rbp

After:
rbp=0x1

As we can see, MOST_POSITIVE_NUM*MOST_POSITIVE_NUM=0xc000000000000001, this happens because only 64bit can be hold and the rest of the bits will be truncated. And the final result will be 1.

4.
If the Emacs executable is compiled with -fsanitize=undefined, the trace will output "runtime error:" message and probably abort when there is undefined behavior, which in our case is signed overflow.

5.
If the Emacs executable is compiled with -fwrapv, the trace will wrap around the signed overflow, which leads to incorrect mathematical result.

6.
Since we will assume fwrapv, we can remove the int overflow checker in "arith_driver" function to simply wrap around the overflow without performing overflow checking.

7.
The overflow checker inside the "arith_driver" function only has a couple lines of instructions and it doesn't consume much time. Therefore, in terms of Big O, with and without the overflow checking won't affect the efficiency significantly.
