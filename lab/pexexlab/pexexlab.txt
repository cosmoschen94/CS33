Gather Instruction Traces

1. I typed the following to entered gdb.
$ gdb --args ~eggert/bin64/bin/emacs-24.5 -batch -eval '(print(* 6997 -4398042316799 179))'

2. In gdb, before I began tracing, I set:
(gdb) set disassemble-next-line on

3. Then I set a breakpoint at Ftimes then run:
(gdb) break Ftimes
(gdb) run

4. While tracing, I used the followings to go through traces and gather registers' information:
(gdb) si
(gdb) info r
